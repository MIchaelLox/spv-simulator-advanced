# SPV Simulator Advanced
Upgraded Track-A-FACE: web-based cost simulation engine.

## Phase 2 To-Do 
1. Expose cost engine as REST API (Flask/FastAPI).
2. Add multi-scenario comparison (Good vs Cloud Kitchen).
3. Integrate MAPAQ risk API for adjusted costs.
4. Modern React/Blazor UI + CSV/PDF export.
